In here it will be described how the program will work
and how to make it if you want to do it on your own.

====================

Have the computer RANDOM the random word in the beginning
and save it under "master_word".

OUTPUT out the menu that you can she in the menu txt document
this is where you can choose to continue to play or see rules by
(For the future decide between computer vs player and 
player vs player)

INPUT of player.

    Rules:
    From the rules txt file, OUTPUT out all the rules neatly
    and inform the player how to play. By input of the player
    use "Back" to come back to the main menu.

    Continue:
    When continue player decides between 4 difficulties by INPUT
    the name of the difficulties.

        Gameplay:
        LOOP a system where the player INPUT a character and see
        if the master_word character is the same. IF NOT take away
        a live and build the hanging man and guess again.
        
        (Count somewhere in here how many tries you have done
        and print the hanging man and get a game over if you get
        the amount of tries you have.)

        ELSE check out the word and print out the dashes and put in
        where the character should be.

            When done get INPUT by player IF you want to play again
            or not, if yes do everything again or ELSE close the
            program.
