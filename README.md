# Hangman

Hi! My name is Elias Axonov and I study at Eberstainska Gymnasiet Norrk√∂ping and got to make a programming project in my programming course.
I got to make an advanced hangman and so it started. This will be update for certain on thursdays and fridays.

I will not type much for the public but it's public just for fun sake so anyone can watch when this develops.
Hope you like to follow this and see how it ends. I think it will be a great end with a good result.

Feel free to copy anything you want and use it on your own, I want to help everyone so if this can help you your welcome :D
